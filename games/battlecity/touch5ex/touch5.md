# touch5.html - Event-Driven Multi-Player Touch Controls

## Overview

The touch5.html implementation represents an evolution in our control system architecture, separating the input handling logic into a dedicated `touch.js` module while maintaining the same user experience as touch4.html.

## Architecture

### touch.js - Input Controller

- **Initialization**: Automatically locates all player controls using DOM selectors
- **Event Handling**: Manages all touch and mouse interactions centrally
- **Event Publishing**: Implements a publisher-subscriber pattern with the following events:
  - `arrow-down`: Triggered when a directional button is pressed
  - `arrow-up`: Triggered when a directional button is released
  - `fire-down`: Triggered when the fire button is pressed
  - `fire-up`: Triggered when the fire button is released

### touch5.html - View Component

- **Event Subscription**: Registers callbacks for all input events
- **UI Management**: Updates visual indicators and status displays based on received events
- **State Tracking**: Maintains the current state of all player controls

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Input handling logic is completely isolated from UI code
- **Reusability**: The input controller can be easily integrated into other projects
- **Maintainability**: Changes to input handling don't require modifications to the UI code
- **Consistency**: Ensures identical user experience to previous implementations
